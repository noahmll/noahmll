## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Noah!  

I am a student at the TH KÃ¶ln and studying *Data and Information Science* there.  
 - 16.10.: This is the first task. As of now, I have no idea how any of this works.  
My enthusiam for coding is way larger than *Durhat's*. He is mad because he knows I'm right. **HAHAHAHA**  
Haters stay mad _frfr_!

- 31.10.: Honestly, I forgot to continue updating my personal Read-Me, but as you can see from my commit history, I did actually continue doing the tasks regularly.

:)
